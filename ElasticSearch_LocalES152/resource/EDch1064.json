Considering that many are also struggling with employment barriers (language, race, religious duties, and lack of education and credentials), dress is at least one area where Somalis can look and behave like everyone else. For women, on the other hand, this is a more complicated issue. In Somalia, Western-style dress for women was never really accepted and, in some cases (e.g., the miniskirt), openly condemned. Any other style of dress\u2014whether the jilbab, or shuka and khimar, or dirac and gorgorad\u2014can be read as a symbol of a woman\u2019s commitment to Somali culture.

The northern coast is less than one hundred miles from the Arabian Peninsula and shares a great deal of history and dress with that region. In the cities, houses are built with thick walls to keep out the heat; in the deserts, nomadic people live in shelters constructed of branches covered with leather or plastic, and distinct differences in dress exist. Nomadic dress has typically been more practical and flexible, consisting of leather, cotton wrappers, and loose garments made of thin cotton and synthetic fabrics. For centuries, Somali dress has incorporated many imported garments and jewelry. When Somalia was colonized by Italy and Great Britain, however, Somalis were not quick to adopt these styles of dress. Many turned to religion for moral and political support, and Islamic dress became a visual symbol of resistance to colonization. In Somalia, Western-style dress for women has never been fully accepted and in some cases it is openly condemned.
